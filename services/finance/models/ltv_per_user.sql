-- Per-user unit economics: the model both cost designs deferred to, now
-- buildable because core carries revenue.
--
-- Two views, on purpose:
--   * contribution_margin_eur = revenue - VARIABLE cost. The standard LTV
--     numerator, and the one that makes ltv_to_cac comparable to any figure
--     quoted outside this repo.
--   * fully_allocated_eur = revenue - TOTAL operational cost - marketing cost.
--     The accounting truth. It is negative for essentially every user, as it
--     is for real companies at this stage. Carrying both means the headline is
--     the standard one and nothing is hidden.
--
-- NOTE: analytics.revenue_per_user (core) and analytics.marketing_cost_per_user
-- (marketing) are produced by *other* dbt projects and are referenced by raw
-- schema-qualified name. They must NOT be turned into ref() calls.
