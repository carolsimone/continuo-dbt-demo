"""Generate the two transaction seeds, carrying the fee the company earns.

Writes services/core/seeds/seed_card_transactions.csv and
services/core/seeds/seed_fx_transactions.csv. Reads
seed_user_acquisition.csv, so run gen_users.py first.

fee_amount is the reason this generator exists. Before it, every transaction
model carried gross volume -- what customers moved -- and nothing carried what
the company earned on it, which made LTV uncomputable. The fee cannot be
inferred from the other columns: seed_fx_rates_eur only ever covers
currency_from, so no cross-rate can be built from the seed alone.

Card fees are EUR. FX fees are denominated in currency_from, so
fx_transactions_eur converts them with the same rate_to_eur join it already
uses for amount -- no new join, no new failure mode.

`rate` is the true mid-market cross-rate. The old seed's value was noise (for
currency_to='EUR' rows it should have equalled rate_to_eur and was off by an
order of magnitude). The margin is fee_amount, never a hidden spread.

Placement is by days since acquisition rather than by calendar month, which
makes created_at >= acquired_at true by construction instead of by clamping.

Run from repo root (AFTER gen_users.py):
    uv run python scripts/gen_transactions.py
