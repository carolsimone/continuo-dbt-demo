"""Generate services/finance/seeds/seed_operational_costs.csv.

One row per (cost line, month) for 2023-01 .. 2024-12 — the window covered by
core's seed_users. Costs and user acquisition must overlap, otherwise
operational_cost_per_user has costs with no users to allocate them to.

Amounts are derived from a stable md5 hash of (subcategory, month), never
`random`, so re-running produces no diff.

# (category, subcategory, cost_type, base_eur, monthly_growth) -- 10 cost lines,
# sized for a ~6-person fintech serving 2,000 users, not a large company.
#
# The split matters: ltv_per_user headlines contribution margin, which
# subtracts ONLY the variable lines. Fixed lines are excluded from the LTV
# numerator and show up in fully_allocated_eur instead.
#
# Variable lines drift upward with the month index as the user base grows;
# fixed lines only jitter around their base.
#
# Over 24 months these total ~EUR 40k variable (~EUR 20/user) and ~EUR 706k
# fixed (~EUR 353/user), which puts contribution margin at ~EUR 81 against
# ~EUR 101 of revenue and leaves fully-allocated at ~ -EUR 302. A company
# burning at Series A, which is the honest shape.
