"""Generate services/marketing/seeds/seed_marketing_spend.csv.

One row per (campaign, month) for 2023-01 .. 2024-12 — the window covered by
seed_user_acquisition. Spend and acquisition must overlap, otherwise
marketing_cost_per_user has spend with no users to allocate it to. Referral
rows are computed from seed_user_acquisition.csv (bounty x referrals that
month), so this script must run after gen_users.py.

Amounts, dates, impressions and clicks are derived from a stable md5 hash of
(campaign, month), never `random`, so re-running produces no diff.

Run from repo root:  uv run python scripts/gen_marketing_spend.py
